# CS559-Final readme

Game Requirements all Satisfied:

Game design

The player controls Elsa in a magical environment, using her ice powers to defeat enemies. The game involves casting spells, dodging attacks, and strategically targeting monsters, creating a mix of action and strategy in a winter-themed fantasy setting.

User interaction

Players interact with the game primarily through the keyboard. Pressing the SPACE key triggers Elsa’s ice magic, and potentially other keys could control movement or camera angles. Input is handled in real time to make casting and movement responsive.

Animation

Character and environment animations include Elsa’s arm movements when casting ice, hair and cape swaying, dress crystals sparkling, and particle effects for ice spells. Monsters may also have animated behaviors for walking or reacting to attacks, creating a lively, dynamic scene.

Automation

Non-playable characters (monsters) are controlled programmatically. They move in the environment, respond to collisions with ice spells, and apply health/damage logic automatically. Special behaviors, such as bosses or spring/winter monster types, are automated through scripts to react to the player’s actions.
